# Pomodoro
This is a basic work tracking app that plays a sound-effect at the end of configurable work sessions and breaks. It also records the previous sessions and displays the work sessions for each date in a date-picker. Also, it has a hours graph, which shows typical working hours in each week-day. Also, it generates a bar graph that plots number of minutes worked at the past at each date as well as 7-day moving average for the amount of work done at each day.
